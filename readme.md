# Data Structure and Algorithms

This repository store my own implementations of some of the most important data structures and notable algorithms and some notes about the complexities. It serves as a study for me and, if may help, fell free to copy, study by, or contribute.

## Main Objectives

- [ ] Lists (Simple, Double Linked and Circular)
    - [ ]  Insertion
        - [ ] Insertion on the beggining
        - [ ] Insertion at the end
        - [ ] Insertion at specific position
    - [ ] Deletion
        - [ ] Deletion at the beggining
        - [ ] Deletion at the end
