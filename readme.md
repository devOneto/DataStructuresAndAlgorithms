# Data Structure and Algorithms

This repository store my own implementations of some of the most important data structures and notable algorithms and some notes about the complexities. It serves as a study for me and, if may help, fell free to copy, study by, or contribute.

## Main Objectives

Implement:

- [X] Lists (Simple, Double Linked and Circular)
    - [X] Traverse
    - [X] Insertion
        - [X] Insertion on the beggining
        - [X] Insertion at the end
        - [X] Insertion at specific position
    - [X] Deletion
        - [X] Deletion at the beggining
        - [X] Deletion at the end
        - [X] Deletion at specific position
    - [X] Search
        - [X] Search element by value
        - [X] Search element by position
